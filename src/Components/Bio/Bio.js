                        <h1>Biography on the Ancient Greek Empire</h1>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Alexander the Great, said to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest strategist of all time. His empire stretched from Greece to the west of India. His influence still reaches to us today and teaches us. We can learn from the great empire he brought together. 
                
                        He was said to be the son  of Zeus, who it is said that Zeus used to come to earth in the form of an animal and get women to sleep with him. Alexander the Great takes the title of being a demigod, modeling his favorite heroes, Hercules and Achilles.</p>
                
                        <h2>Childhood</h2>
                
                        <p>Alexander the Great was born in Pella, Greece, to his parents Olympias and King Philip II in 356 BC. His dad led the way for him by being a great military leader. His dad had always dreamed of taking Persia and made the foundation for Alexander the Great. 
                
                        In his childhood, Alexander was tutored by one of the most famous Greek philosophers and teachers, Aristotle. Some say that that is where Alexander gained some of his knowledge that enabled him to be successful.
                
                        When he was 16, his father left to go to battle, leaving Alexander in charge. Alexander proved himself through defeating the Sacred Band of Thebes, who were said to be an unbeatable army, in the Battle of Chaeronea
                        His story
                        Alexander The Great became king in 336 BC when his father was assassinated by his bodyguard. When Alexander became king, he killed all his competitors and secured his kingship.
                
                        Alexander the Great ruled Persia. Although he was the ruler, he did not force them to change customs as most rulers would do, but rather allowed the people to stick to their Persian customs and even adopted some of the customs himself.
                
                        The Macedonians started to hate Alexander more and more. His friend while being drunk, insulted him and Alexander killed him, making the Macedonians hate him even more.
                
                        Alexander pushed his military to India to help his political situation. They got tired and therefore Alexander didn't pursue his plans to take all of it.
                
                        The Macedonians were getting rich through Persian riches, but because of fighting them for a long time, they hated each other and didn't get along. To help this situation, Alexander made his men marry Persian princesses hoping that their sons and daughters would be loyal to him.
                
                        This made the Greeks angry and threatened to mutiny until Alexander replaced them with the Persian officers and soldiers. The troops backed off their mutiny and then Alexander held a feast for all and gave back the Greeks their military ranks and respective places in the army. 
                
                        Alexander spread a lot of Greek culture to the ancient world because of the expansion of his empire, influencing the ancient world. The unity he made brought the Hellenistic age. He made many of the ancient world's “most important centers of cultural and scientific development.” He also made his own currency, bringing trade across his empire.
                
                        Their wealth also boosted trade among the Mediterranean, “and a period of prosperity settled over the region”</p>
                
                        <h2>Death</h2>
                
                        <p>Alexander the Great was 32 when he died. We don't know exactly how Alexander the Great died, but people have many different ideas. Some say he was poisoned, while others think he got malaria. His death sparked war and conflict in the empire. Alexander the Great's death also sparked the beginning of the Hellenistic period from 323-31 bc.</p>
                
                        <h2>Achievement</h2>
                
                        <p>A great achievement he had was holding his empire together through the struggles they went through. It wasn't an easy task to unite many people who have been at war with each other. He spread culture all around the empire, letting people to choose whether or not they want to learn it, influencing a large throng of people. Alexander the Great's kingdom spread from Greece to the west of India. Alexander the Great conquered some of the greatest empires of the time and earned respect from the empires. He was a remarkable leader and strategist, earning him to one one of the greatest of all time.</p>
                
                        <h2>Archaeology Connection</h2>
                        
                        <p>Although Alexander had a short lived life and empire, he still had great achievements that are there for the world to see. He is known for making cities in his name, including Alexandria in Egypt. He made many figures and statues that showed his image. He also made coins that had his figure on them. This is archaeological evidence of Alexander the Great and his empire. How old they are can help them confirm the time period and can also see some of the culture from that time period. Through him making a name for himself through these figures, we are able to see who Alexander the Great really was, and appreciate him even more.</p>
